Thinking of a command and control for LLMs: the idea is that an LLM
*always* writes Forth-like code to a socket to execute on the server
within a per-client dictionary, and the server always responds in
natural language; even when the LLM wants to talk to people it uses
Forth commands that mimic Twitter or IRC, which lets it communicate
values as well as text.
